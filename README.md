HTML5 static page.

## Gulp tasks

- `gulp dev` : start server at `http://localhost:8080/` ready for livereload with chrome extension.
- `gulp dist` : compile html & css (didn't set "build" to avoid "troubles" with netlify).

## Updates

- Versions are living on different branches
- Master should be correctly tagged at branch merge

## Roadmap
